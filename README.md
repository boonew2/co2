#Simple Javascript game

Currently hosted at http://52.0.52.217/pac_mania

Directions:
- Arrow Keys move character
- Space bar moves everything,but the character
- Goal is to 'eat' as many points as possible until out of lives

Notes:
- Everything runs client side so the repo can be cloned and ran locally pretty easily
- Might be worth adding a 2 player mode to get some webRTC experience.
